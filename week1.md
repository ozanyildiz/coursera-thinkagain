What is an argument?
--------------------

* Series of sentences, statements
* Includes premises
* Includes conclusion
* Premises supports and gives reason for conclusion

Why we give arguments?
----------------------

* Persuading
* Justifying
* Explaining

Persuading
----------

If somebody tries to `change` your idea on something, tries to `convince` you, his/her arguements are persuading arguments. He/She will be very happy if you act the way he wants. Yes, salesmen! [Bad reasons]

Justifying
----------

If somebody just gives you `reasons` to believe something, this is for justification. He/She won't be unhappy if you believe in the opposite way. [Good reasons]

Explaning
---------

If somebody tells you `why` he/she believes what he/she believes, this is for explanation. In this case, you and him/her already know the conclusion is true. But more important thing is why that is true? They want us to `understand` why that is true?

Types of explanations:

* Causal - *(very basic reasoning)*
* Teleological - *(why?)*
* Formal - *(kind of scientific)*
* Material

How to explain something?
-------------------------

* First mention about the general facts.
* Then fit your example into the general fact you previously mentioned.
